| **Harnessing AI for Smart Farming**  | This web application, built with Python's Flask framework in Visual Studio Code, empowers farmers with advanced tools for sustainable agriculture. Leveraging machine learning (CNN and Random Forest algorithms), it detects 38 leaf diseases, predicts crop yields for informed planting, recommends optimal fertilizer usage, and offers a supplement shopping module for targeted plant support. The built-in chatbot aids farmer with their queries, fostering knowledge and informed decision making. This application holds significant potential for the future, with possibilities for integration with IoT and edge computing to enable real-time data collection and on-farm analysis                                           | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             
| **Personal Finance Management System**  | Developed a Personal Finance Management System using the MERN stack in Visual Studio Code. The app featured functionalities for tracking income and expenses, and thereby achieve financial goals. Leveraging Postman for API testing and development, I successfully created a user-friendly tool that empowered users to effectively manage their finances and make informed financial decisions.                                                | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/devikaajay/Personal-Finance-Management)          |
**Pregnancy Monitoring System**  | This project developed a mobile application using Visual Studio Code to provide comprehensive support for pregnant women. The app offered features such as personalized health tracking, educational resources, and a chatbot to address concerns. By tracking vital signs, weight, and fetal development, the app empowered women to monitor their health proactively. Additionally, the app provided access to a chatbot that offered advice and resolved issues related to pregnancy.                                            | [Repo Link 3](https://github.com/username/project3)             |
**Hospital Management System**  | This project developed a web-based Java application, built with NetBeans IDE and utilizing a workbench framework, to streamline hospital operations. By automating tasks like patient management, appointment scheduling, and record keeping, the HMS enhanced efficiency and reduced errors. The system provided features for online appointment booking, doctor assignment, and medication management, while ensuring data security and privacy.                                  | [Repo Link 4](https://github.com/username/project4)   |
